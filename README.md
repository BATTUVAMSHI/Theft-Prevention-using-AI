# Theft-Prevention-using-AI
Build a theft prevention using AI and computer vision which will help an individual or a group of family members to get notified about the intrusion into the house/property.
The system should recognise the family members (at least 1) as innocent and anyone apart from recognised faces will be treated as an intruder.
Once an intruder is identified the system should trigger an email with the picture captured.  
Rules:
You can use a webcam as a security camera. 
The moment you come in front of the camera, it should recognise you as an innocent and not intruder
.Points to focus: 
Train a model to recognise known faces (At least one) 
Write a function to differentiate Known face (innocent) to an intruder Setup any SMTP service (Gmail, etc) which is free.
Use Haar cascades to recognise a human and/or a face.
